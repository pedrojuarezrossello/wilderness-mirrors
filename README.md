personal dictionary is an applet I've designed after a month learning python (my first programming language) as practise. It allows the user to store words they don't know alongside their definitions, synonyms and an example. Then it creates flashcards to test the user's knowledge, and it learns which words the user struggles with and asks them more frequently in tests.
